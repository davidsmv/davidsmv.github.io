		<h2>Sobre mí</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Hello there! My name is David Martinez and I am a business administrator with a focus on finance and internationalization processes. I have experience in the area of purchasing, two junior consultancies, and data analysis in the area of pricing. I am an organized person who is always eager to learn new things. I consider myself creative, respectful, loyal, committed, and convinced that technology is the key tool for the progress of our society.

I have knowledge in SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Holistics, Web Scraping, and Python. Currently, I am learning everything related to machine learning and I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge in this area.

I have worked in various companies, including Tul, a Colombian startup that sells to hardware dealers through its app. Here, I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst and was responsible for ETL (Extract, transform, load) of market information in order to support a pricing policy and better understand the market for Colombia, Brazil & Mexico. I also constructed a market information tracking dashboard for decision making using Holistics, a cloud platform for Business Intelligence (BI).

In addition, I have worked in Habi, a Colombian startup that buys and sells houses, known as proptech, as a pricing analyst. Here, I was responsible for the initial and final stage pricing of real estate through market values and data analysis for all cities where Habi has a presence.

If you are interested in learning more about my experience or would like to connect with me, please feel free to reach out to me at (+57 3213871557) or visit my LinkedIn profile at (https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsmv). I look forward to hearing from you!</li>

	My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4308998634">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
	How to Avoid a Climate Disaster was a good book that helped me to have a better view of the climate problem. I can understand the key factors that make this problem worse and learned what society and I can do to achieve the goal of zero carbon emissions. I would highly recommend it.
